It looks like your message got cut off 🙂
Can you clarify what you want to do with this structure?

For example, do you want me to:

Explain this folder structure (what each part is for)?

Create or improve the README.md for this project?

Suggest best practices / improvements to the structure?

Convert this into a monorepo setup explanation (e.g., backend + app + shared)?

Add tooling (TypeScript, Prisma, API contracts, etc.)?

If you meant something like “explain this” or “help write README.md”, just say which one and I’ll take it from there.

explain this

Here’s a clear explanation of your project structure and what each folder is typically used for 👇

📁 wellness-platform/

This is the root of your project. It contains everything needed for the wellness platform: backend, frontend app, shared code, and documentation.

📁 backend/

This folder contains your server-side code (API, database, business logic).

📁 backend/src/

Main backend application code

Examples:

API routes / controllers

Services (business logic)

Auth logic

Middleware

Usually written in TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js, NestJS, Express, etc.)

📁 backend/prisma/

Prisma ORM configuration

Contains:

schema.prisma → database models

Migrations → database version history

Handles communication between your backend and the database

📁 app/

This is the frontend application, likely mobile or web.

📁 app/screens/

Full pages / screens of the app

Examples:

LoginScreen

HomeScreen

ProfileScreen

Common in React Native, Expo, or structured React apps

📁 app/components/

Reusable UI components

Examples:

Buttons

Cards

Inputs

Used across multiple screens to avoid duplication

📁 shared/

This folder is for code shared between backend and frontend.

📁 shared/types/

Common TypeScript types and interfaces

Examples:

User

Appointment

API response types

Helps keep backend and frontend in sync and reduces bugs

📄 README.md

Documentation for the project

Usually includes:

Project overview

Tech stack

Setup instructions

How to run backend and app

Folder structure explanation

✅ Why this structure is good

Clear separation of concerns

Easy to scale

Shared types reduce mismatch between API and UI

Works well for monorepos

If you want, I can:

Write a professional README.md

Suggest improvements to this structure

Add an example file layout

Explain how backend & app communicate

Just tell me 👍

so wellness_platform is the folder.it has backend folder with 2 subfolders?

Yes 👍 exactly.

✅ Correct understanding

wellness-platform/ (or wellness_platform/) is the main/root folder of your project.

Inside it, you have a backend/ folder, and that backend folder has 2 subfolders:

wellness-platform/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   └── prisma/

What that means:

backend/ → the entire server-side part of your app

backend/src/ → where all backend code lives (APIs, logic, auth, etc.)

backend/prisma/ → database setup and models (Prisma schema + migrations)

So yes:

wellness_platform → backend → (src + prisma) ✅

And alongside backend/, you also have:

├── app/        → frontend (screens + components)
├── shared/     → shared types between frontend & backend
├── README.md   → documentation


You’re thinking about it the right way 👍
If you want, I can also draw a mental model (backend vs frontend vs shared) or explain how data flows between them.

src/

this will be  the folder or code?

Good question — this is an important distinction 👍

Short answer

👉 It’s a folder, not a single file.

In your case (specifically src/)
wellness-platform/
└── backend/
    └── src/


src/ is a folder

It contains your actual backend code files

What goes inside backend/src/?

src/ usually stands for “source code”.
Inside it, you put many code files and subfolders, for example:

backend/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts        // entry point of backend
│   ├── server.ts       // server setup
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── user.ts
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── services/
│   └── utils/
└── prisma/
    └── schema.prisma


So:

src/ → folder

index.ts, server.ts, etc. → code files

Same idea applies elsewhere

app/screens/ → folder containing screen code files

app/components/ → folder containing reusable component files

shared/types/ → folder containing TypeScript type files

Simple rule to remember

Folders organize things (src, components, screens)

Files contain actual code (.ts, .tsx, .js, .json)

If you want, I can show:

a very minimal backend src/ example

or how src connects to Prisma and the app

Just tell me 🙂

wellness-platform/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   └── prisma/ so in this example every world is folder?

Almost 🙂 — not every word, but every name with a trailing / is a folder.

Let’s break your example down very clearly.

wellness-platform/
├── backend/
│   ├── src/
│   └── prisma/

✅ What are folders here?

All of these ARE folders 👇

wellness-platform/ → folder

backend/ → folder

src/ → folder

prisma/ → folder

The / at the end means directory (folder).

❌ What is NOT shown here?

No files yet

No code files like .ts, .js, .json

No README.md in this specific snippet

If there were files, they would look like this:

├── README.md      ← file (no `/`)
├── index.ts       ← file

Easy rule to remember 🧠

Ends with / → folder

Has an extension (.md, .ts, .js) → file

Example with both folders + files
backend/
├── src/            ← folder
│   └── index.ts    ← file
└── prisma/         ← folder
    └── schema.prisma ← file


So yes — in your example, everything shown is a folder ✅

If you want, I can explain why we separate src and prisma or help you create the first file inside src.
